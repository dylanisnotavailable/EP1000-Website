				<h2>Final Project</h2>	

				<p>What does it do? 
                
                </p>

				<p>This is a simple lamp that emits a soothing blue light. The initial idea was for it to respond to sound, as well as play a few select sound bytes. However, this has fallen by the wayside as shipments for crucial components was delayed.</p>

<p>I opted to place a clear cover over the electronic compnents, temprarily held on by tape but a more permanent solution will be added soon.</p>

				<p>I fully intend on adding the initially-planned features when I am able to, in order to be fully satisfied with this project. </p>
